<h2>Command Line</h2>

<p/>
By default DICOM+ runs as a GUI, but if given the <code>-c</code> option it will run as a command line.
Running as a command line can be useful when processing a large number of files.
<br/>
<p/>
When used this way, only anonymize one patient at a time.
<br/>
After the options, any number of files or directories may be listed for input.
<p/>
The following usage is shown when giving the command with the <code>-h</code> option:
<p/>
<code>DICOM+ -h</code>
<p/>
<div >
Usage:
    DICOMClient [ -h ] [ -c ] [ -P patient_id ] [ -o output_file ] [ -3 ] [ -z ] [ -g ] inFile1 inFile2 inDir1 inDir2 ...
    <br/>
    <div style="margin-left:40px;">
        <p/>
        <strong>-h</strong> Show this help and then exit (without GUI)
        <p/>
        <strong>-c</strong> Run in command line mode (without GUI)
        <p/>
        <strong>-P</strong> Specify new patient ID for anonymization
        <p/>
        <strong>-o</strong> Specify output file for anonymization (single file only, command line only)
        <p/>
        <strong>-d</strong> Specify output directory for anonymization (can not be used with -o option)
        <p/>
        <strong>-y</strong> Truncate all dates to just the year, eg: 19670225 -> 19670101
        <p/>
        <strong>-s</strong> When reading files, keep recursively searching through sub-directories
        <p/>
        <strong>-F</strong> (Flat) The default.  Store created files into the same directory.  Use only one of -F, -T, or -L
        <p/>
        <strong>-T</strong> (Tree) Store created files in patient ID / series tree under specified directory
        <p/>
        <strong>-L</strong> (Local) Store created files in local directory as a child of their source directory.  Requires write access to source directories.        
        <p/>
        <strong>-3</strong> Restrict generated XML to 32 character tag names, as required by the SAS software package
        <p/>
        <strong>-t</strong> Show attribute tag details in text dump (effective in command line mode only)
        <p/>
        <strong>-l</strong> preload.xml Preload UIDs for anonymization.  This allows anonymizing to take place over multiple sessions.
        <p/>
        <strong>-z</strong> Replace each control character in generated XML files that describe DICOM attributes with a blank.  Required by SAS
        <p/>
        <strong>-g</strong> Perform aggressive anonymization - anonymize fields that are not marked for
           anonymization but contain strings found in fields that are marked for anonymization.
        <p/>

<h4>Command Line Options</h4>

<strong>Help: -h</strong>
Shows the above usage message and then exits regarless of any other options.
<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Command Line Mode: -c</strong>
Required for operating the program in command line mode.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Output File: -o [file]</strong>
Specify the output file for anonymization.  This option can not be used with the -d option.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Output Directory: -d [dir]</strong>
Specify the output directory for anonymization.  Valid in command line mode only, and also only when anonymizing a
single file.  This option can not be used with the -o option.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Truncate to Year: -y</strong>
When anonymizing, change the month and day for all dates to 1.  For example, the date 19560321 would change to 19560101.
This is applied to all attributes with the VR of DA or DT (Date or Date Time).

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Read files recursively: -s</strong>
When reading files, search recursively through the inputs given.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Flat: -F</strong>
When writing files, put them all in the same directory.  Can not be specified with either -L or -T.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Tree: -T</strong>
When writing files, put them in a tree by patient and series.  Can not be specified with either -F or -L.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Local: -L</strong>
When writing files, put them under the directory that originally contained them.  Can not be specified with either -F or -T.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Shorten XML Tags: -3</strong>
When generating XML, restrict tag names to 32 characters. This is to support the consumption of the
XML by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)'>SAS</a> packages.  Note that there is no
official DICOM for tag names.  

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Attribute Details in Text: -t</strong>
When generating text files, add the attribute details instead of just the attribute names.  This includes the group number,
element number, 
<a href="@@vr.ref@@">VR</a>
and 
<a href="valueMultiplicity.html">VM</a>.  This is similar to clicking the <code>Details</code> checkbox in the GUI text preview.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Preload Anonymization UIDs: -l</strong>
This feature is not fully implemented.  The intent of this feature is to support the saving and
restoring of a DICOM+ session.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Remove CTRL from XML Tags: -z</strong>
When generating XML, replace control characters with a blank.  This is to support the XML interpreter used by
the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_(software)'>SAS</a> packages.

<div style="margin-top:25px;"></div>
<strong>Aggressive Anonymization: -g</strong>
When anonymizing, look for instances of the patient's name in text fields, such as StudyDescription and other description
fields.  If found, replace it with <code>none</code>.
