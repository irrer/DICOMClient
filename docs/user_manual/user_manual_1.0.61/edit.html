<h2>Edit.html</h2>

The <code>Edit... </code> button near the lower right in the <a href='preview.html#PreviewText'>preview</a> 
window (in text mode only) opens the window shown below:

<h2>Notes on Editing</h2>

<h3>Selecting an Attribute</h3>
To select an attribute for editing, use the mouse to click on it in the
preview screen.  The selection will be highlighted in grey as shown here:
<br/>
<p/>
<img src='../editSelectAttributeOrig.png' style='margin-left:40px;'/>
<br/>
<p/>


<h3>Validating Attributes</h3>
Cursory validation is performed on the changes made to files, but the
user is largely responsible for entering valid data.
<p/>
It is also possible to make a DICOM file invalid by deleting required attributes or
adding attributes that are not allowed for the given modality.  Again, the use is
responsible for using attributes correctly.
<p/>


<h3>Update</h3>
<br/>
The most frequent editing operation is to update (change) an existing value.  To update, select an
attribute and then click the <code>Update</code> button.
<p/>
The window will show the current value(s) of the attribute.  Enter the changes and
then click the <code>Update</code> button in the lower right corner.
<p/>
Note that you can only update primitive values such as numbers and strings.  If a sequence attribute
is selected, then the <code>Update</code> button is disabled.

<p/>
<h3>Create</h3>
<br/>
When creating a new value, the root of the attribute tree is assumed by default.  If you want to
create a value in a sub-tree sequence, then select an attribute at the same level, or the parent attribute.
When the <code>Create</code> is clicked a window like this will be shown:
<p/>
<img src='../editCreateSelect.png' width='837'/>
<p/>
After selecting the attribute to be created, fill in value(s) as shown:
<img src='../editCreateValues.png'  width='837'/>


<p/>
<h3>Copy</h3>
<br/>
The DICOM specification does not allow duplicate attributes, so only sequence items can be copied. The
<code>Copy</code> button will only be enabled when a sequence item is selected.
<p/>
To perform a copy, select the sequence item and then click <code>Copy</code>.  If an item contains a tree
of sub-items, then the entire tree will be copied.


<p/>
<h3>Delete</h3>
<br/>
Any item may be deleted.  To delete an item, select it, and then click the <code>Delete</code> button.  If the
attribute contains other attributes, then the entire tree is removed.



<p/>
<h3>Options</h3>
<br/>

The <code>Editing Options</code> window lets you control how editing changes are saved.
The default is to save all slices in the series as DICOM without overwriting the original files, as shown below:
<p/>
<br/>
<img src='../editOptionsOrig.png' width='837' style='margin-left:40px;'/>
<p/>
Any combination of boxes may be selected, though at least one of the last four should be selected or nothing will be saved.

<p/>

<ul>
	<li><code>Save to all slices in series</code> If selected, the
		edits will be made to all slices and they will all be written to disk.
		If not selected, only the current slice will be changed and saved.<p/></li>
	<li><code>Over-write original file(s)</code> If selected, the
		original files are over written, otherwise new files are created and
		put in the destination folder indicated in the main window.<p/></li>
	<li><code>Save as DICOM</code> Save the files as DICOM<p/></li>
	<li><code>Save as text</code> Save metadata as text. This can be
		useful for later viewing or processing with other tools.<p/></li>
	<li><code>Save as PNG image</code> Saving as PNG allows importing
		the image into other tools or web pages. This is ignored if the file
		is not an image modality, such as RTSTRUCT.<p/></li>
	<li><code>Save as XML</code> Saving as XML puts the metadata in a
		structured format that can be interpreted with other software tools.<p/></li>
</ul>
