<h2>Anonymizing Files</h2>

Before anonymizing, first make sure that the application is in
anonymize mode using the <code>Anonymize</code> radio
button at the top left of the main window.

<p/>
<br/>

If a particular patient ID is desired, enter it in the <code>New Patient ID</code> 
field.  This field is initialized to a random value at startup.  The pattern for
this is defined in the configuration file.

<p/>
<br/>

Be default, the patient name is set to the same value as the patient ID.  If they
need to be different, click the checkbox to the right of the <code>New Patient Name</code> 
field, which will enable the field and a different name to be entered.

<p/>
<br/>
To anonymize a series,
click the <code>Anonymize</code> button to the
right of the series.  When complete, the green and white plus sign will
indicate that the series has been anonymized.

<p/>
<br/>

One of the features of the program is to properly handle the anonymization of UIDs
across files within a series and study.

particular for Radiotherapy where the
relationships and cross-references between
DICOM files is complex.'>(more info)</moreinfo>
After anonymization, the generated files will have new UIDs and the relationships
between files will be maintained, provided that the files were anonymized in the
same session.

<p/>
When files are anonymized, they are put in the <code>Destination</code> shown near the
top of the main screen.  The destination may be changed by using the <code>Browse</code> button.
<p/>
If the <code>Destination</code> does not exist, it will be created as anonymization begins.
If you do not have permission to write files, then anonymization will fail.
Note that repeatedly anonymizations will create a new set of files on each invocation.
<p/>
An entire patient may be anonymized by clicking the <code>Anonymize Patient</code>
button in the uppor right hand corner of each patient's information.

<p/>

Multiple patients may be anonymized by clicking the <code>Anonymize All</code>
button at the bottom of the main window.
