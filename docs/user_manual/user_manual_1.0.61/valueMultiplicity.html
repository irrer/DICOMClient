<h2>DICOM Value Multiplicity Table</h2>

Value Multiplicity, or VM, is the number of values an attribute is expected to contain.  The most common
is 1, but for example, when specifying a three-dimensional coordinate it makes sense to have 3, and a list
of specifying a three-dimensional coordinates should have a length that is a multiple of 3.

When showing Details, the VM is shown to the right of VR (Value Representation), as shown in the highlighted portion below:
