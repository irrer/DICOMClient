<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p />
<br />
<strong>Will DICOM+ over-write my existing files?</strong>
<br />
In general, no - The program is designed to preserve existing files. Both
anonymization and editing create new copies of the files. Before a new
file is written, the program checks to make sure that the name it is
using is unique.

The only exceptions are:

<ul>

    <li>When editing a file, the user overrides the default and indicates that the
        original file should be over-written.</li>

    <li>When the user repeatedly saves during an edit session, the
        same destination file is used.</li>

</ul>
<p />
Note that if the same series is anonymized multiple times, it will
result in multiple sets of files. This is by design, as a common use
case is to anonymize the same set of files multiple times with different
user IDs to create test data.

<strong>How does DICOM+ anonymize UIDs?</strong>
<br />
It replaces all of them with new ones, maintaining the cross-references
between files. This is especially important in radiotherapy, where a
patient often has a set of files including images (CT, MR, etc.),
RTSTRUCT, RTPLAN, RTDOSE, and other files that share UIDs between
series.
<p />
To maintain the cross-references, all files for a given patient must be
anonymized in the same session.
<p />
This is also required by the DICOM specification. See the DICOM
standard:

<strong>How does DICOM+ construct file names?</strong>
<br />
File names are constructed so as to be human readable, and are formatted
with the following fields (if they are present in the source DICOM file)
separated by underscore:

<ul>
	<li>Patient ID</li>
	<li>Modality</li>
	<li>Series Number</li>
	<li>Instance Number</li>
</ul>

If the resulting file already exists, an integer is appended to the name
to make it unique.



<p />
<br />
<strong>Does DICOM+ use 32 or 64 bit?</strong>
<br />
Either. The version of the Java runtime on your machine determines which
will be used, but DICOM+ uses the same BAT and library files regardless.
The advantage of 64 bit is the ability to work with larger data sets,
but otherwised they behave identically.
